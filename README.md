Simple movie recommendation chat bot thing.

To run simply put all the files into visual studio

Download node.js

Go to power shell to setup the server:

npm install express cors openai node server.js

$env:OPENAI_API_KEY="API KEY HERE"

node server.js

If it doesn't allow u to run scripts just use:

Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass

After the server is up and running just go back to visual studio and run ur html file and u should see the website pop up,
and now ur movie recommendations should work, if it still doesn't then that means you dont have any money to use your API
