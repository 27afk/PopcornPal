PopcornPal is an easy-to-use movie recommendation chatbot that helps you find movies based on your preferences.

To set it up, first download or clone the repository and open it in VS Code.
Make sure Node.js is installed on your machine.
Open a terminal or PowerShell in the project directory and install the required dependencies by running npm install express cors openai.
Set your OpenAI API key with $env:OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE".
Start the server using node server.js.
If PowerShell blocks script execution, you can temporarily allow it with Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass.
Once the server is running, open the HTML file in VS Code or your browser to interact with PopcornPal and get movie recommendations instantly.

This project was developed by Alex (27afk) and RJ (rjsteedmanyippeee).
